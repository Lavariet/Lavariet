Hi there, I’m Manuel aka @Lavariet

 Some of the Techs I like:
 
- JavaScript / Typescript
- Node and Deno 
- Go
- React

 And a bunch of which I don't like xD:
- Java, instant legacy overengineered overcomplicated Code
- Angular, I dislike Annotations as they break 'Code Structure / Flow' 
- Vue, don't like the custom directives
- Svelte, great idea, whacky syntax
- Stuff like Lit or Stencil, goes to show that the web components / custom elements idea is popular, 
  but putting it in a class based structure with a bunch of overcompilication and inconvenience was
  not a good idea for a standard
  
 I’m currently learning 
- more React
- Graphql
- Deno
