Hi there, I’m Manuel aka @Lavariet

 Some of the Techs I like:
 
- EcmaScript
- Node 
- Go
- kinda interested in Rust

 And a bunch of which I don't like:
- Java, instant legacy overengineered overcomplicated Code
- Angular, Vue, React and basically every oder Framework as they overengineer the solution to oftentimes simple problems
  
 I’m currently learning 
- (Job) more React
- (Job) Graphql
- (Job) Node
- Go
